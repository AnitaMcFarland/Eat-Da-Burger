# Eat-Da-Burger

This is an activity to add burgers and devour burgers when clicking on buttons.  "Eat-Da-Burger" is a full-stack site that will use  MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and  ORM . It will follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
